A Simple Shell: In this project, you are required to implement a simple shell program by
using fork()/execv() system calls. Your code should support the basic bash-like shell
functions, such as loading and running a program, and also some advanced features, such as
background execution (&) to execute a program in the background, pipe (|) to direct output
from one program as input to another program, and I/O redirection (>) to send output to
another file. Your simple shell should also support a special command “history”, which
displays the latest 100 commands typed by the user and “histat”, which displays the top 10
most frequently typed commands in the descending order.

Failed to implement some advanced features.
