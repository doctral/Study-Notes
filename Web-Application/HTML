HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): not a programming language, it is a markup language that defines the structure of a webpage. 

Block elements and inline elements:
   Block element forms a visible block on a page, which starts from a new line: <p>  </p>
   Inline element will not cause a new line: <em> </em>, <a>, <strong>, etc

Empty elements (void elements): consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place. i.e: <img>

Attributes: contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content.
An attribute should have:
    1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes.)
    2. The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.
    3. An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.
Some attributes:
    <a>: anchor that makes the piece of text a hyperlink.
    <href>: link to the web address to its value. 
    
Boolean Attributes: attributes without values or only have one value that is generally the same as the attribute name. 
     For example: <input type="text" disabled="disabled">  // disabled has one value
                  <input type="text" disabled>    // same as above
     
Single quotes and double quotes are equivalent in HTML, but you should not mix then. 
      <a href="http://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>
      <a href='http://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>

Anatomy of an HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>

1. <!DOCTYPE html> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype; that's all you really need to know.
2. <html></html>: The <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.
3. <head></head>: The <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't 
   the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear 
   in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more. 
4. <meta charset="utf-8">: This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from 
   the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no 
   reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
5. <title></title>: The <title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page 
   is loaded in, and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
6. <body></body>: The <body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, 
   whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

No matter how much whitespace you use (which can include space characters, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each one down to a single space when rendering the code.
<p>Dogs are silly.</p>
<p>Dogs        are
         silly.</p>    // they are equal

To include special characters in HTML, each character reference is started with an ampersand(&) and ended by a semi-colon(;). 
Literal character	                Character reference equivalent
<	                                        &lt;
>	                                        &gt;
"	                                        &quot;
'	                                        &apos;
&	                                        &amp;

For example: <p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
             In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.
             
HTML comments: 
    To turn a section of content inside your HTML file into a comment, you need to wrap it in the special markers <!-- and -->
